    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A very light and fluffy pancake recipe that requires fresh buttermilk, but it's the best I've ever made!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Flour:</b> All-purpose flour contains gluten, which gives the buttermilk pancakes structure and pleasant chewiness.</li>
        <li><b>Sugar:</b> Just three tablespoons ofwhite sugar should be enough to lend subtle sweetness. Remember, you'll be adding a lot more sugar if you top the pancakes with syrup or molasses!</li>
        <li><b>Leaveners:</b> Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners (a substance that releases gas when mixed with other ingredients, causing the batter to rise to fluffy perfection).</li>
        <li><b>Salt:</b> You definitely don't want to skip adding a small amount of salt â€” the buttermilk pancakes will taste bland without it.</li>
        <li><b>Buttermilk:</b> Of course, you'll need buttermilk for buttermilk pancakes! This recipe calls for three whole cups.</li>
        <li><b>Milk:</b> Wholemilk helps create the perfect batter consistency and cuts some of the buttermilk's acidity.</li>
        <li><b>Eggs:</b> Three whole eggs add structure and rich flavor to the buttermilk pancakes.</li>
        <li><b>Butter:</b> Melted butter lends flavor and keeps the pancakes nice and moist.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Mix the Dry Ingredients:</b> Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
        <li><b>Mix the Wet Ingredients:</b> Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.</li>
        <li><b>Make the Pancakes:</b> Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. 
            Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown.</li>
    </ol>
